		"Copy the contents of the disk into the folder you just created.",
		"Reboot, and when the bootloader opens, selct the new OS, and hit enter.",
		"Viola! You're done!",
		"Note: If the OS crashes immediately, it's likely not compatible. Don't lose heart! The next major release (2.0) will fix many of these issues.",
